Hello, my name is Siyuan. I'm currently a graduate student majoring in CS at the Ohio State University. This is my new personal blog hosted on Github. I'll record interesting thoughts and things in my life here.

I enjoy jogging and soccer in my spare time. And I'm an enthusiast of artificial intelligence. I like to design algorithms to let computers to play all kinds of games against humans. Also I'm quite interested in hardware and software interface, where much hacking can happen:)
